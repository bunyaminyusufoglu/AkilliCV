At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.\n\nYour Role\n\nHello, my name is Stanislav, and I lead the UX team at WebPros. I joined the company in 2019 as a designer, driven by a passion for creating superior design solutions informed by data and usability studies. I firmly believe that effective UX design is achieved through close collaboration with users and leveraging their insights.\n\nOver the past years, I've witnessed firsthand how product teams can overcome challenges with the help of robust UX practices. Conversely, I've seen the difficulties faced by teams that don't prioritize UX. These experiences have only strengthened my conviction in the value of a user-centered approach.\n\nAs the UX lead, my mission is to empower cross-product teams with comprehensive UX practices and demonstrate the benefits of a UX-focused strategy. I am looking for a talented UX designer who shares my values and is equally passionate about data- and customer-informed design to join me on this journey and help drive our vision forward.\n\nAs a UX Designer at WebPros, you will be at the forefront of designing intuitive and engaging web applications. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to understand user needs, translate them into design solutions, and ensure a seamless user experience. Your role will involve conducting user research and testing, creating prototypes, and collaborating with developers to bring your designs to life. You will champion the design process within cross-functional teams and grow UX maturity within your area of responsibility.\n\nBelow, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.\n\nYour Impact In The First 180 Days\n\nWe don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months. \n\n First 30 days:\n Get acquainted with the team and company culture.\n Get into the product subject matter.\n Understand the details of design processes within the UX team.\n Start participating in design reviews and feedback sessions.\n First 60 days:\n Begin conducting user research and gathering insights.\n Develop prototypes for ongoing projects.\n Collaborate with developers to refine and implement design solutions.\n First 120 days:\n Lead user testing sessions and iterate on designs based on feedback.\n Present design solutions to stakeholders, backed by data and user insights.\n Contribute to the development of design guidelines and best practices.\n First 180 days:\n Take full ownership of the design projects within your area of responsibility and drive them to completion.\n Champion the design practice within cross-functional teams, highlighting its benefits for the team and the product.\n Continuously improve the user experience through data-informed design decisions.\n After 180 days, you should:\n Establish yourself as a key influencer in the UX domain within the products of your responsibility.\n Drive UX initiatives that align with business goals and user needs.\n Collaborate with other designers and cross-product teams, fostering a culture of data-informed design.\n Continuously advocate for user-centered design principles and practices across the organization.\nYou’ll Thrive Here If You\n\n Love designing web applications and diving into complex subject matter.\n Enjoy talking to users and understanding their needs.\n Are skilled at articulating design solutions with data and user insights.\n Can work autonomously and handle the entire design process from initial discovery to collecting data on the implemented product.\n Are passionate about evangelizing the design process and growing UX maturity.\n\nYou Might Struggle Here If You\n\n Mostly rely on your taste or \"general best practices\" when designing UX.\n Don't like writing. As a remote-first company, we rely heavily on written documentation.\n Not keen on conducting UX studies.\n Can't present your design decisions to stakeholders with data and business needs in mind.\n Find it challenging to handle the design process autonomously.\n\nHow We Work\n\n Team & Workflow: The UX team is a remote-first team consisting of 4 UX designers and 1 UI/Graphic designer. The Eastern European time zone is the default, but the work schedule is flexible.\n Collaboration & Ownership: Self-managed work with a strong emphasis on accountability, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making. Typically, you will collaborate on product tasks with PM and developers in cross-product teams and with other designers on design system issues. When it comes to usability research, you will reach out to customers together with the PM.\n Tech Stack & Tools: Figma, Lyssna (automated UX research), FigJam, Miro, Typeform, MixPanel. Depending on the product, the front-end stack may include React, Angular, or Vue. Therefore, communicating with developers requires basic knowledge of these frameworks.\n\nOur Culture\n\nWebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.\n\nWe are a fully remote, async-friendly company where transparency, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving define how we work. Whether you thrive in the fast pace of a startup or the stability of an established product, WebPros offers a dynamic, evolving career journey that you can shape based on your strengths.\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable workplace where every team member feels valued, heard, and supported because our diversity is our strength.\n\nCompensation & Benefits\n\nWe believe benefits go beyond just perks. At WebPros, we invest in your growth, flexibility, and well-being, so you can do your best work and build a meaningful career. While we strive to provide equal global benefits for all team members, some may vary by location, and we’ll clarify the details with you during the interview process.\n\n Competitive salary\n Remote-first flexibility: Work from anywhere in Europe (or hybrid in available offices).\n Development Budget: Annual personal growth allowance.\n Learning Support: Udemy subscription & peer learning.\n Public Transport & Meal Vouchers: Location-dependent benefits.\n Paid Time Off: 20+ days of annual leave depending on your location.\n Team Culture: Regular team and on-site company events.\n\nYour Hiring Experience\n\nHi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.\n\nHiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.\n\nInterview Process\n\nScreening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team. We’ll discuss your motivation, career aspirations, and how your experience aligns with the role while giving you as much insight as possible into what to expect.\nHiring Manager Interview (60 min): A focused session with the Hiring Manager to evaluate your skills, past experience, and communication style. This is your chance to ask detailed questions about the role and get a clear sense of what success looks like in the position.\nTest Task (async): A take-home assignment designed to reflect the kind of challenges you’d work on in the role. It gives us insight into your approach, problem-solving skills, and creativity.\nTest Task Review (internal): We’ll review your submission internally to assess your approach and how it aligns with our expectations. Based on this review, we’ll either invite you to the next step or provide feedback on your work.\nTeam Interview (45-60 min): A group conversation with the Hiring Manager, Lead UX Designer, and potentially a representative from the product team. If you’re invited to this stage, you’ll present your test task, receive feedback, and engage in a discussion from different perspectives. This is also a chance for all of us to get a sense of how we might work together.\n\nOur Commitment To a Diverse & Inclusive Culture\n\nAt WebPros, we want every team member to feel excited to bring their full, authentic self to work. Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences driving innovation and making us stronger together.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances. We foster a culture of belonging, respect, and psychological safety, where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute meaningfully and grow.\n\nDiscrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nWe are looking forward to your application!\n\nBest,\n\nStanislav & Florian",
